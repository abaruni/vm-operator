          NetworkInterface is the Schema for the networkinterfaces API.

                  PortAllocation is a request to allocate a port for this network interface on the backing network.
                  This feature is currently supported only if backing network type is NetworkTypeVDS. In all other
                  cases this field is ignored. Typically this is done implicitly by vCenter Server at the time
                  of attaching a network interface to a network and should be left unset. This is used primarily when
                  attachment of network interface to the network is done without vCenter Server's knowledge.
